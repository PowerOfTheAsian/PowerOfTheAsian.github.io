	Hello, I am Renel Einon Tan. I am an aspiring Game Developer.
	</p>
	<p>
	As my applied skills are lacking and I have very little actual real life experience have a sleeping Hollow Knight that I used to copy from my Year 1 Website making class.
	</p>
    <p>
    I mostly specialize in theorizing in Game Design. 
    </p>
	<p>
	This site non-profit and is in compliance with the required output of class CS 3105 of University of San Carlos - Talamban Campus.
